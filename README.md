CS-250 Module Eight Journal Entry – Sprint Review & Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I’ve learned that interpreting user needs starts with stepping into their shoes. It means not just thinking about what they say they want, but also understanding what problems they’re trying to solve. Writing user stories helped me break that down into clear and actionable goals. It gave each task a purpose by focusing on what the user expects to get out of the feature. Instead of just saying “Add a slide show,” a user story reframes it to “As a wellness visitor, I want to view tips in a rotating slideshow so I can stay engaged with the content.” That kind of clarity made it easier to prioritize what to build and how to test it.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach programming with a plan-first mindset now. I’ve realized how important it is to stay flexible, get feedback early, and never assume you’re done after the first draft. Agile helped shape that mindset. The daily scrums, story estimation, and clear roles really made things run smoother. In the future, I want to continue using user stories, backlog prioritization, and sprint planning no matter what size team I'm working with. Even if I'm working solo, I can still adapt Agile practices to help me stay organized and deliver code that’s thoughtful and aligned with real user needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is about more than just writing solid code. It’s about being accountable, staying communicative, and supporting the flow of the team. I learned quickly that no one wants a team member who disappears, ignores feedback, or holds things up by not asking questions. A good teammate speaks up, owns their part, and always has the end goal in mind—delivering quality software that works for the user. In every sprint, I worked to be that teammate. I shared ideas, stayed on top of my tasks, and made sure to understand not just what I was coding, but why it mattered.
